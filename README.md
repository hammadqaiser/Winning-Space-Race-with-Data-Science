# Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project

## üìå What is Capstone Project?
A capstone project is a final multi-phase assignment typically required at the end of a program. It is the most comprehensive demonstration of everything you have learned throughout your program. It can take various forms, including research papers, presentations, or practical work. It serves as a bridge between academic theory and practical application, helping to develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. The term ‚Äúcapstone‚Äù comes from architecture‚Äîit refers to the top stone placed on a building to complete it.

## üöÄ Project Overview
A data science case study to predict if SpaceX can successfully land the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket, thereby revolutionizing space travel by reducing costs. This project covers the full data science lifecycle: data collection via REST API and web scraping, data wrangling, exploratory analysis, interactive visualization with Folium and Plotly Dash, and finally, building and comparing multiple machine learning classification models.

## üìä Data Sources
1.  **SpaceX API:** Collected launch data using a custom Python script.
2.  **Web Scraping:** Scraped Falcon 9 launch records from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches) using `BeautifulSoup` to complement the API data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip`

### Running the Dashboard Locally
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hammadqaiser/Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science.git
    cd Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the Dash application:
    ```bash
    python src/spacex_dash_app.py
    ```
4.  Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`

### Running the Analysis Notebooks
Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook from the root directory and navigate to the `Jupyter Notebooks/` folder.

## üìà Methodology
1.  **Data Collection:** Programmatically gathered data from API and HTML.
2.  **Data Wrangling:** Handled missing values, created new features (e.g., `Landing Outcome`), and normalized data.
3.  **EDA:** Used SQL and Pandas to analyze relationships between variables like launch site, orbit type, and payload mass.
4.  **Interactive Maps:** Created Folium maps to visualize launch sites and outcomes.
5.  **Predictive Analysis:** Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict first stage landing success. Optimized hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.
6.  **Dashboard:** Built an interactive web application with Plotly Dash to visualize results and make predictions.

## üéØ Results & Key Findings
*   The best performing model was **Logistic Regression Classifier** with an accuracy of **83.34%**.
*   Key factors influencing successful landing include:
    *   **Payload Mass:** Lighter payloads have a higher success rate.
    *   **Launch Site:** Certain sites have historically higher success rates.
    *   **Orbit Type:** Missions to specific orbits are more conducive to recovery.
*   **Conclusion:** Data-driven analysis successfully predicted the landing success of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. By gathering data from the SpaceX API and web scraping, we identified key factors that influence a successful landing, including payload mass, orbit type, and launch site. Our exploratory analysis with visualizations and SQL queries confirmed these findings, revealing a clear upward trend in SpaceX's success rate and highlighting the most reliable launch locations. The Logistic Regression Classifier proved to be the most accurate predictive model, providing a reliable tool for our startup to make more informed and competitive bids. These insights offer a significant strategic advantage, allowing us to target market segments with a higher probability of success and thereby increase our competitiveness against SpaceX.
