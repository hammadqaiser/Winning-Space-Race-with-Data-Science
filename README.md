## What is Capstone Project?
A capstone project is a final multi-phase assignment typically required at the end of a program. It is the most comprehensive demonstration of everything you have learned throughout your program. It can take various forms, including research papers, presentations, or practical work. It serves as a bridge between academic theory and practical application, helping to develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. The term “capstone” comes from architecture—it refers to the top stone placed on a building to complete it.
